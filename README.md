## Target:
Building an EUR/USD converter

## Language:
Single page application in React

## Required features:

1.	Display a result corresponding to EUR/USD fx rate. It will be set to 1.1 by default.
Every 3 seconds, a random value comprised between -0.05 and +0.05 will be added to (or subtracted from) the initial value.

2.	Build a Front page in React allowing the user to enter an amount in EUR and displaying the converted value in USD, taking the fx rate into account.

3.	Implement a polling allowing the update of the USD part depending on the fx rate.
4.	Add a switch to enter an amount in USD instead of EUR:
a. Switch set to "EUR": the amount is entered in EUR and result value in USD
b. Switch set to "USD": the amount is entered in USD and result value in EUR

5.	Make sure there is a continuity in the values: when the switch is activated the former output should
become the new entry.

6.	Add a field to override the fx rate.

7.	Deactivate the override on the fx rate (if activated) when there is a 2% difference with the real time
fx rate. The conversion should then be done using the real time one.

8.	Display a table with historical data of the 5 last results (corresponding to the 5 last conversions).

9.	This table should display: the real time fx rate, the override, the initial amount with associated currency and the converted one with the associated currency.

A special consideration must be given to the UX.
